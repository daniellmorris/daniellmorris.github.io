# Building Scalable Microservices: Lessons Learned

When building microservices at scale, there are several critical factors to consider. In this post, I'll share some key insights from my experience developing and deploying microservice architectures that handle millions of requests daily.

## Key Considerations

1. Service Boundaries
2. Data Consistency
3. Error Handling
4. Monitoring and Observability

## Service Boundaries

One of the most crucial aspects of microservice architecture is defining proper service boundaries. This involves:

- Understanding business domains
- Identifying data ownership
- Managing service dependencies
- Ensuring loose coupling

## Data Consistency

Maintaining data consistency across microservices requires careful consideration:

```javascript
// Example of handling distributed transactions
async function updateUserAndPreferences(userId, userData, preferences) {
  const transaction = await beginTransaction();
  
  try {
    await userService.update(userId, userData);
    await preferencesService.update(userId, preferences);
    await transaction.commit();
  } catch (error) {
    await transaction.rollback();
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential in distributed systems:

```javascript
class ServiceError extends Error {
  constructor(message, statusCode, serviceName) {
    super(message);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.serviceName = serviceName;
  }
}

async function handleServiceRequest(request) {
  try {
    const result = await processRequest(request);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({
      error,
      service: 'UserService',
      request: request.id
    });
    throw new ServiceError(
      'Failed to process request',
      500,
      'UserService'
    );
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

Implementing comprehensive monitoring is crucial:

```javascript
const metrics = {
  requestCount: 0,
  errorCount: 0,
  responseTime: []
};

app.use(async (ctx, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  metrics.requestCount++;
  
  try {
    await next();
    metrics.responseTime.push(Date.now() - start);
  } catch (error) {
    metrics.errorCount++;
    throw error;
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

Building scalable microservices requires careful planning, robust error handling, and comprehensive monitoring. The key is to start simple and iterate based on actual needs rather than presumed requirements.
