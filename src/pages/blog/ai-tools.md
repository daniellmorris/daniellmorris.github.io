# Using Bolt.DIY with Docker for Full-Stack Web Development

## Why Use Docker?

### Benefits of Docker

1. **Isolation**: Docker containers encapsulate all the dependencies and configurations needed to run an application, ensuring that it runs the same way regardless of where it's deployed.
2. **Consistency**: With Docker, you can be confident that your application will behave the same in development, testing, and production environments.
3. **Portability**: Docker images can be easily shared and deployed across different systems, making it easier to collaborate with other developers.
4. **Clean Environment**: By using Docker, you avoid installing dependencies directly on your machine, keeping your system clean and free from potential conflicts.

### Why Avoid Running on Your Own Machine?

Running applications directly on your machine can lead to several issues:

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Different projects may require different versions of the same dependency, leading to conflicts.
- **System Clutter**: Installing multiple dependencies can clutter your system and make it harder to manage.
- **Environment Differences**: Your development environment may differ from the production environment, leading to unexpected issues.

By using Docker, you can avoid these problems and ensure a smooth development experience.

## Setting Up Bolt.DIY with Docker

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Steps to Run Bolt.DIY with Docker

1. **Clone the Bolt.DIY Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy.git
   cd bolt.diy
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build . --target bolt-ai-development -t bolt-diy
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 bolt-diy
   ```

   This command will start the Bolt.DIY application inside a Docker container and map port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host machine. You can now access Bolt.DIY by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Writing This Blog with Bolt.DIY

### The Story

As a developer, I was excited to try out Bolt.DIY for my next project. However, I didn't want to clutter my system with additional dependencies. I decided to use Docker to run Bolt.DIY in a clean, isolated environment.

I started by cloning the Bolt.DIY repository and building the Docker image. The process was straightforward, and within minutes, I had the application running inside a Docker container. I navigated to `http://localhost:3000` and was greeted by the Bolt.DIY interface.

Using Bolt.DIY, I was able to prompt, run, edit, and deploy my full-stack web application seamlessly. The integrated terminal allowed me to view the output of my commands, and the ability to revert code to earlier versions made debugging a breeze.

As I worked on this blog post, I appreciated the clean environment provided by Docker. My system remained uncluttered, and I didn't have to worry about dependency conflicts. The portability of Docker images also meant that I could easily share my setup with other developers.

In conclusion, using Bolt.DIY with Docker provided a smooth and efficient development experience. I was able to focus on writing code and building my application without worrying about managing dependencies or cluttering my system.
